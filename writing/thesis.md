# After Class: Bringing Social to Massive Open Online Courses

## Background

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are the latest incarnation of free, open public education which use the power of the internet to deliver educational content to audiences around the world. All MOOCs share two important common traits, they must have open access, meaning not only free, but also without limitations on location or organizational affiliation, and they must be scalable, meaning they can easily accommodate tens or hundreds of thousands of users (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). These traits often also lead to content being highly structured, and the courses relying heavily on a strong community of students to ask and answer questions in the online forums or Q&A systems. 

One of the earliest MOOC-like systems was iTunes U which offers recordings of courses taught at Universities or other educational institutions. This system currently has over 350,000 videos in its library. Khan Academy is another service that was an early MOOC system, offering 3500 micro lectures directed primarily at grade school children.

In the last year three different websites have begun to offer MOOCs, both Udacity and Coursera began offering courses in April 2012 and now have one million and 750,000 members respectively. One key difference in the two sites is that Udacity courses are taught by people as individuals, while Coursera courses are offered as part of a partnership with universities. A third similar website, edX, has popped up in Fall 2012 as a partnership between MIT and Harvard to offer MOOCs. 

Although MOOCs began in technical areas, they have now spread to many different areas of study including statistics, chemistry, poetry, and many other liberal arts topics. These non-technical topics have created extra challenges in requiring human grading of written homework responses.


## Motivation

Social interaction plays a large role in the current on campus educational system. Many of the most important lessons and discussions happen outside of class in coffee shops, office hours, and dorm rooms. Similar interactions could play an important role in online courses as well giving students a sense of community, a chance to form meaningful study groups or groups for projects, and allow for other social interactions that lead to a better learning experience. One aspect of social interaction that becomes especially important in online courses is the sense of community that it offers, allowing students to realize they are not alone in the class, and therefore have an outlet to discuss problems or lack of understanding with other students.
Existing Solutions

All MOOC systems have created some system for allowing students to interact amongst themselves or with course staff. Both Udacity and Coursera have Q&A style forums that allow students to ask questions and vote on the best answer, this system however limits the amount of discussion that can happen on a topic. For some of the more discussion based courses in the humanities, Coursera has set up live webcasts of panel discussions on topics several times throughout the course. These discussions are moderated and often allow students to either submit questions electronically or wait in a queue to have a chance to join the webcast. 

Coursera has additionally teamed up with the website MeetUp which allows students to organize in-person meetups with groups in cities across the world. This system does allow for some face-to-face social interaction, but the MeetUp site only has a group for Coursera students, not individual courses, leaving students on their own to find a group that will share similar interests. Moreover these meeting are to occur in person limiting the availability only to those living in larger cities.


## Collaboration Ready


## Toward a Social MOOC

In order to create a social environment for students in a MOOC we have created a system that acts to assist students in find a social group within courses they are taking. These social groups are encouraged to use existing digital interaction systems such as skype or Google hangouts to meet with each other one or more times a week throughout the course. 

We have chosen to create smaller groups to encourage more intimate social interaction and provide social incentives to reduce dropout rates. To form groups we use a questionnaire that asks about the motivations and interests of a student when taking a MOOC.
